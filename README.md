The portal of cataclysmic variables is a catalog that contains information aboutstars in space. Users will be able to view this information and also be able to insert information about new or discovered stars that were not yet known.
The portal uses two catalogs as an information base. They are the catalog [Ritter and Kolb](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/RKcat/cbcat) and the [Downes and Shara](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/cvcat/ASCII_Report.html).
**The project is still under construction**
