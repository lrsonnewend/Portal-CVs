The cataclysmic variable portal is a catalog containing information about stars in space. Users will be able to view this information, query for a specific object, and also enter new star information already in the catalog or enter unknown star data through a page administrator who will check whether the information given by the user is true.
The portal uses three catalogs as the information base: [Ritter and Kolb] (https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/RKcat/cbcat), [Downes and Shara] (https://archive.stsci.edu / prepds / cvcat / ASCII_Report.html) and [SIMBAD] (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/).

The system is being developed in JSP, with Java version 7, Tomcat 7.0.55, HTML5 and CSS3

**The project is still under construction**
